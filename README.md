 Final project - Hungry Squirrel Game
    Apply all concepts learned in class to create a "Hungry Squirrel Game". Requirements are to ingest a map of the game, receive starting coordinates from the player, then allow the player to move on the map and collect peanuts/almonds, while avoiding "poisonous" cashews.
    Peanuts/almonds result in nutrition points while cashews will kill the squirrel and end the game.
